# NES-RustEmu-Follow

Following the blog / tutorial found [here](https://bugzmanov.github.io/nes_ebook/) by [@bugzmanov](https://x.com/bugzmanov).

I am doing this to (1) become more comfortable with Rust and (2) get a better grasp on how emulators should be structured.

My goal is to make a gameboy emulator after this. I will apply what I have learned.

Again, big thanks to [@bugzmanov](https://x.com/bugzmanov). The blog / tutorial is a great help.
